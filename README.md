# Project Title

PacktGrab

## Getting Started

You must have Python 3 and Pycurl installed on your computer.
You must add your PacktPub username and password to lines 25 and 26 respectively.
SSL did not want to verify properly for me, so I downloaded a root cert from cURL's website and point to it's path\filename on line 24.
